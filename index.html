  <p>Welcome to my website.</p>

<h1> <b>Example</b></h1>

<p><i>British Admiral Howe's got troops on the water
    Thirty-two thousand troops in New York harbour
    Thirty-two thousand troops in New York harbour (thirty-two thousand troops in New York harbour)
    When they surround our troops, they surround our troops
    When they surround our troops (they surround our troops)
    As a kid in the Caribbean, I wished for a war
    I knew that I was poor
    I knew it was the only way to rise up
    If they tell my story
    I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or rise up
    I will fight for this land
    But there's only one man who can give us a command, so we can rise up
    Understand? It's the only way to rise up, rise up
    Here he comes
    Ladies and gentlemen!
    (Here comes the General!) The moment you've been waiting for!
    (Here comes the General!) The pride of Mount Vernon!
    (Here comes the General!) George Washington!
    We are outgunned (what?)
    Outmanned (what?)
    Outnumbered, outplanned (buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)
    We gotta make an all out stand
    Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man (buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)
    Check it, can I be real a second?
    For just a millisecond?
    Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
    Now, I'm the model of a modern major general
    The venerated Virginian veteran
    Whose men are all lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
    Writin' letters to relatives, embellishin' my elegance and eloquence, but
    The elephant is in the room
    The truth is in your face when you hear the British cannons go boom!
    Any hope of success is fleeting
    How can I keep leading when the people I'm leading keep retreating?
    We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
    Knight takes rook, but look
    We are outgunned (what?)
    Outmanned (what?)
    Outnumbered, outplanned (buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)
    We gotta make an all out stand
    Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man (buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)
    Incoming!
    They're battering down the battery, check the damages (rah!)
    We gotta stop 'em and rob 'em of their advantages (rah!)
    Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
    Hamilton won't abandon ship, yo, let's steal their cannons
    Shh-boom, goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray, and
    And boom, goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay
    And boom, there's another ship
    And boom, we just lost the southern tip
    And boom, we gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
    Guns and horses giddyup
    I decide to divvy up my forces
    They're skittish as the British cut the city up
    This close to givin' up, facing mad scrutiny
    I scream in the face of this mass mutiny
    Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
    We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
    I cannot be everywhere at once, people!
    I'm in dire need of assistance
    Your excellency, sir!
    Who are you?
    Aaron Burr, Sir
    Permission to state my case?
    As you were
    Sir, I was a captain under General Montgomery until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
    And well, in summary
    I think that I could be of some assistance
    I admire how you keep firing on the British from a distance (huh)
    I have some questions, a couple of suggestions
    On how to fight instead of fleeing west
    Yes?
    Well-
    Your excellency, you wanted to see me?
    Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?
    Yes, sir, we keep meeting
    As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out
    Burr?
    Sir?
    Close the door on your way out
    Have I done something wrong, sir?
    On the contrary
    I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
    Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh
    Sir?
    Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?
    Sir!
    Don't get me wrong, you're a young man of great renown
    I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
    Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you
    Yeah, to be their Secretary? I don't think so
    Now why are you upset? I'm not
    It's alright, you wanna fight, you've got a hunger
    I was just like you when I was younger
    Head full of fantasies of dying like a martyr?
    Yes
    Dying is easy, young man, living is harder
    Why are you telling me this?
    I'm being honest
    I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
    We are a powder keg about to explode
    I need someone like you to lighten the load, so?
    I am not throwing away my shot!
    I am not throwing away my shot!
    Ayo, I'm just like my country, I'm young, scrappy and hungry!
    I am not throwing away my shot!
    Son, we are outgunned, outmanned!
    You need all the help you can get
    I have some friends, Laurens, Mulligan
    Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?
    Outnumbered, outplanned!
    We'll need some spies on the inside
    Some king's men who might let some things slide
    I'll write to Congress and tell 'em we need supplies
    You rally the guys, master the element of surprise
    (Chicka-boom!) I'll rise above my station, organize your information
    'Til we rise to the occasion of our new nation, sir!
    Here comes the General
    Rise up! (What?)
    Here comes the General
    Rise up! (What?)
    Here comes the General
    Rise up! (What?)
    Here comes the General
    (What?) And his right-hand man!
    Boom!
