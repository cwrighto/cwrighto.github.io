    <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
    <p>
      My name is Charlie Wright. I am a junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I am passionate
      about mechanical product design.
      <br>
      I also enjoy computer science, something I was unfamiliar with until taking the introductory course at Cornell
      where I grew to really love it. This inspired me to pursue a Computer Science minor and to join the course staff
      for that same course which sparked my interest, where I hope to create that same spark within other students. I
      look forward to exploring the development of computer graphics and
    </p>

    <h2 class="colorDisplay"> Some of my favorite classes at Cornell:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>MAE2250: Mechanical Synthesis</b> - This course explored the </li>
      <li><b>MAE2030: Dynamics</b> - This course </li>
      <li><b>CS1110: Intro to Computer Science (Python)</b> - This course sparked my interest in computer science and
        inspired me to become a TA. I had found coding to be tedious to learn in high school, but the professor for this
        course brought so much enthusiasm to his lectures, and was always exceptionally clear in his explanations of
        concepts that I found myself really loving programming and computer science as a whole. He had some extremely
        fun moments and always knew how to wrap up a lecture, including my favorite mic drop of his that everything in
        Python we had known up to that point was an Object. I am thankful that I have the opportunity to explore my
        passions at a university with professors who reciprocate that enthusiasm.</li>
      <li><b>PE : Swing Dance</b> - I took this course with a few friends because we knew we would have to dance with
        partners, but the instructors made us constantly swap between partners every minute or so. Because of this I
        got to know everyone in the class pretty well and became more comfortable just starting a dance with someone.
        It was very fun to adapt to everyones different dancing style. My friends and I even looked through our own
        music
        playlists and found songs with great rhythms to rock-step to outside of class. </li>
      <li><b>VIEN : Cider</b> - This course explored the history, economics, and biological and chemical processes
        behind cider production. I really wanted a class where I could learn a lot about one very specific topic. If I
        were not an engineer I think I would definitely exploreFood Science because I really enjoyed learning about the
        science behind cider and apple production.</li>
